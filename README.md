The FIoT-Client Python is a Python library that eases the use of IoT and Context APIs from FIWARE platform.

## Getting Started

<!--These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. -->

### Prerequisites

Python 2.7+ (Python 3.5+ preferred)

<!--
What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```
 -->

### Installing

You can install the latest stable version of the library from the Python package index, with the following command: 

```
pip install fiotclient
```

or install directly from the cloned repository folder:

```
cd fiot-client-python/
pip install -e .
```


<!--
A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
-->

## Running the tests

To run the available unit tests, you should first configure a local FIWARE stack or use an external stack which you are granted access, so that the communication from the library to the FIWARE platform components can be tested.

[Here](https://github.com/FIoT-Client/fiot-client-tutorial/tree/master/deploy/full) you can find a *docker-compose* file that can be used to run a local instance of the required components.

Next, you should configure the *config.ini* file, placed on **tests/file** folder with the configured FIWARE stack params (addresses and ports).

Finally, the tests can be executed using the following command:

```
python -m unittest
```
